# Crazy-Crush-Game
Game I built with my team at the 2024 Development in Games Association Spring Game Jam. The theme of the Game Jam was "Crush," centered around Valentine's Day. This game is an infinite 2D runner where you're "crazy crush" runs after you as you have to avoid obstacles. Work in progress. Build available at: https://nikil-shy.itch.io/crazy-crush.
